# Load More Functionality Guide

## How Load More Works

### When You'll See the "Load More Contacts" Button

The "Load More Contacts" button appears automatically when:
- Your search finds more than 50 contacts
- There are additional pages of results available
- The system detects more potential contacts to scrape

### What Happens When You Click "Load More Contacts"

1. **Additional Search**: The system searches deeper (8-16 more pages)
2. **New Results**: Finds 12-48 additional contacts
3. **Quality Filtered**: Only shows contacts with 40+ quality score
4. **Added to Table**: New contacts appear below existing ones
5. **Updated Count**: Total contact count increases

### Example Scenario

**Search**: "tech founders"

**Initial Results**:
- 18 contacts found and displayed
- "Load More Contacts" button appears
- Message: "Found 45 total results. Click 'Load More Contacts' to see the next 50 contacts."

**After Clicking Load More**:
- 16 additional contacts found
- Total: 34 contacts displayed
- Button disappears (no more results available)

### No Extra Buttons Needed

- **No additional configuration required**
- **No extra settings to change**
- **Simply click "Load More Contacts" when it appears**
- **The button only shows when more results are available**

### Performance

- **Load More Speed**: 30-60 seconds (depending on search depth)
- **Background Processing**: You can continue using the app
- **Quality Maintained**: Same quality filtering as initial search
- **Export Includes All**: CSV/Excel includes all contacts from all pages

### Tips for Best Results

1. **Use Thorough Mode**: Processes more pages per search
2. **Set Quality Filter to "All"**: Shows all results (including lower quality)
3. **Click Load More Multiple Times**: If available, keep clicking to get more results
4. **Try Different Keywords**: "founders" vs "entrepreneurs" vs "startup leaders"

### When Load More Won't Appear

- Less than 50 total results found
- All available pages have been processed
- Quality filter is set to "Excellent" (60+ score) and few results qualify
- Search depth is set to "Fast" mode (limited pages processed)

**Summary**: The Load More functionality is automatic and appears when more results are available. Simply click the button to get additional contacts without any extra configuration needed.
