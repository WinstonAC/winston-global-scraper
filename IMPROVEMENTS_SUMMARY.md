# Winston Scraper - Robustness Improvements Summary

## ðŸš€ Major Enhancements Implemented

### 1. **Enhanced Phone Number Validation**
- **Problem**: Phone numbers like `9164216462`, `1750963362` were being captured (timestamps/IDs)
- **Solution**: Implemented comprehensive validation that filters out:
  - Timestamp patterns (10-digit numbers starting with 1 or 2)
  - Date patterns (6-8 digit numbers)
  - Sequential numbers (1234567890)
  - Repeated digits (1111111111)
  - Invalid country codes
- **Result**: Only legitimate phone numbers are now captured

### 2. **Improved Contact Name Extraction**
- **Problem**: Many results showed "Unknown Contact" or generic company names
- **Solution**: Enhanced extraction with multiple methods:
  - **Method 1**: Context-aware extraction near email addresses (50-node context window)
  - **Method 2**: Business contact pattern matching across entire page
  - **Method 3**: Meta tag extraction (author, og:author)
  - **Method 4**: Title/heading extraction
  - **Fallback**: Intelligent hostname formatting
- **Result**: Much better contact name detection for business professionals

### 3. **Quality Scoring System**

### 4. **Search Depth Configuration**
- **Fast Mode**: 8 pages processed (quick results)

- **Thorough Mode**: 16 pages processed (comprehensive search)
- **Result**: Users can choose speed vs. thoroughness

### 5. **Quality Filtering Options**
- **All Results**: No filtering (shows everything)
- **Good+ (40+ score)**: Default, filters out low-quality results
- **Excellent (60+ score)**: Only high-quality results
- **Result**: Users can focus on the best contacts

### 6. **Enhanced UI Features**
- **Quality Score Display**: Color-coded quality indicators in results table
- **Search Depth Selector**: Dropdown to choose search thoroughness
- **Quality Filter**: Dropdown to filter results by quality
- **Better Placeholders**: More helpful example text
